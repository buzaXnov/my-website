      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Filip ButiÄ‡ and I am a Data Scientist with a background in Computer Science. I have experience in building machine learning models for various applications, including anomaly detection, automatic license plate recognition, and crowd management. I am also interested in computer vision and natural language processing as well as data science. I am currently looking for new opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to exciting projects.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Master's Degree in Computer Science</li>
        <li>Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb</li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science</li>
        <li>Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture in Split</li>
        <br>
      </ul>
      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Data Scientist @ AISoft Technology [Current position]</li>
        <p>As a data scientist, I trained machine learning models for anomaly detection using PCAP files, a format for network traffic captures. I retrieved, parsed, and stored large volumes of data for training and testing purposes. Once the models were ready, I deployed them to a production environment to enable automated detection and alerting of network anomalies. I also collaborated with cross-functional teams to improve model performance and scalability. Finally, I maintained and monitored the deployed models to ensure their continued effectiveness.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Machine Learning Engineer @ Biss</li>
        <p>As a Machine Learning Engineer, I worked on communicating with clients to understand their requirements for PoCs and existing systems. I was responsible for preprocessing and augmenting data, building data pipelines and models, as well as visualizing data. Additionally, I built backends for various systems, including real-time Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR), crowd management, and demographics prediction systems. Through these projects, I gained experience in deploying machine learning models in real-world applications and working collaboratively with cross-functional teams to meet project goals.</p>
